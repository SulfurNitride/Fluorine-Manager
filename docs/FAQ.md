# FAQ

## Where Are Logs Stored?
Logs are written next to the app binary in a `logs/` folder.

## Does Removing an Instance Delete My Files?
Not by default. It removes the profile from the menu, and gives you the option to delete it if you want to.

## Do I Need UMU and 7ZZ?
Yes, both are bundled in release artifacts under `bin/`.

## Do I Need to Install 9 Million Different Dependencies?
No, the dependencies are handled by NaK! If there is something missing I will gladly add it to the list. This also includes WINEDLLOVERWRITES as well!
