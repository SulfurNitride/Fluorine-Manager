# FAQ

## Where are logs stored?
Logs are written next to the app binary in a `logs/` folder.

## Does removing an instance delete my files?
Not by default. It removes the profile from the menu, and gives you the option to delete it if you want to.

## Do I need UMU and 7zz?
Yes, both are bundled in release artifacts under `bin/`.

## Do I need to install 9 Million different dependencies?
No, the dependencies are handled by NaK! If there is something missing I will gladly add it to the list. This also includes WINEDLLOVERWRITES as well!
